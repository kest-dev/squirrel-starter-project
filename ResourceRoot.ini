# ResourceRoot.ini should be located either in the same directory as the executable file
# or in any of the parent directories.

# Format of the file:
# alias1=relative/path/1
# alias2=relative/path/2
# ...

# When the engine is looking for a resource, it will check the paths from ResourceRoot.ini from last to first.

# It is recommended to use standard aliases in default order and only customize the paths:
# - CoreData: files from `rbfx/bin/CoreData` that should always be updated with the engine.
# - Data: project-specific files that are created and updated by a person.
# - Cache: project-specific files that are generated by the editor.

CoreData=../rbfx/bin/CoreData
Data=Project/Data
Cache=Project/Cache
